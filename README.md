This was originally intended as a geo-location app a la Highlight/GlassMap/Glancee/etc, but they got there first, so this may as well be open-sourced. Mainly just contains the basic object-model, as well as a few API-endpoints.

Also, the various keys that were previously shown in this repo have all been invalidated. Good lesson in not storing this type of info in source control.

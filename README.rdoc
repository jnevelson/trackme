There's still nothing functional here. Took longer than I thought to configure everything and set up a base project.

1. Get login functionality working with "regular" user (not integrated with facebook/twitter/etc) working... DONE
2. Create friending ability (FriendUser join table between two different users)
3. Create controllers for updating geolocation (location API)... DONE
4. Integrate with facebook/twitter/etc
